### Installation for **FrontEnd Project**

Install each one the pieces of software previously mentioned, and install required dependencies.

```bash
# install dependencies
 $ npm install

# install Pods
 $ npx pod-install

```


## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.
To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash

# start metro
 $ npx react-native run-ios

```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Automatic the system opens a _new_ terminal with the _Metro_ menu. Enter the action that you required to start _iOS_ app:

### For iOS

```bash
# metro menu
  r - reload the app
  d - open developer menu
  i - run on iOS
  a - run on Android

```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from Xcode.
